title: Jekyll or Hugo?
summary: After years of procrastination, I finally dove into static site generators. Jekyll didn't click, but Hugo won me over - taking just a few hours to set up with help from Claude. Here's how that conversation went.

I've been procrastinating on setting up a new blog/website--literally--for years, and today I finally looked into static site generators that allow me to simply push my changes to a GitHub repo and let everything build on its own.

I looked at [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and after installing Ruby and some other stuff, I quickly realized that I don't really like it. I can't even say why, it just didn't feel right.

The next one I tried was [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and--well--the result is the website you're currently looking at. All in all, including finding and adapting a theme (I'm using [Today I Learned](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-til/), by Michael Henriksen), setting up the GitHub action, and getting everything up and running, took maby two or three hours. Not bad, Right?

But I must admit that Claude was of great help! If you're interested, here's the conversation transcript:

**Me**

I want to set up a blog, hosted on github pages, with Hugo and a minimalist theme similar to the one used by e.g. simonwillison.net. My local machine is a Windows PC. Guide me through the setup step by step

**Claude**

I'll help you set up a Hugo blog on GitHub Pages with a minimalist theme. Let me create a comprehensive guide for Windows users.

// Beginning of artifact: Setting Up a Hugo Blog on GitHub Pages
## Prerequisites Installation

1. **Install Git**
   - Download Git from https://git-scm.com/download/windows
   - During installation, choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
   - Keep other default options

2. **Install Hugo**
   - Download Hugo Extended from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases
   - Choose the latest Windows-64bit extended version (e.g., `hugo_extended_0.123.0_windows-amd64.zip`)
   - Create a folder `C:\Hugo\bin`
   - Extract the hugo.exe file to `C:\Hugo\bin`
   - Add `C:\Hugo\bin` to your system's PATH:
     - Search for "Environment Variables" in Windows
     - Under System Variables, find "Path"
     - Click "Edit" → "New"
     - Add `C:\Hugo\bin`
     - Click "OK" to save

## Blog Setup

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your GitHub username)
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize it with any files

2. **Create Local Hugo Site**
   ```bash
   # Open Command Prompt and navigate to your desired location
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents

   # Create new Hugo site
   hugo new site my-blog
   cd my-blog

   # Initialize git
   git init

   # Add GitHub repository as remote
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
   ```

3. **Install Theme**
   For a minimalist theme similar to simonwillison.net, we'll use Paper:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper themes/paper
   ```

4. **Configure Site**
   Create/edit `config.toml` with these settings:
   ```toml
   baseURL = 'https://username.github.io/'
   languageCode = 'en-us'
   title = 'Your Blog Title'
   theme = 'paper'

   [params]
     # Paper theme settings
     color = 'light'
     twitter = 'yourusername'  # Optional
     github = 'yourusername'   # Optional

   [menu]
     [[menu.main]]
       identifier = "about"
       name = "About"
       url = "/about/"
       weight = 10
     [[menu.main]]
       identifier = "posts"
       name = "Posts"
       url = "/posts/"
       weight = 20
   ```

5. **Create First Post**
   ```bash
   hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
   ```
   Edit `content/posts/my-first-post.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "My First Post"
   date: 2024-10-28
   draft: false
   ---

   Hello, world! This is my first blog post.
   ```

6. **Create About Page**
   ```bash
   hugo new about.md
   ```
   Edit `content/about.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "About"
   date: 2024-10-28
   draft: false
   ---

   This is my personal blog where I write about...
   ```

7. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:1313 to see your site

## Deployment Setup

1. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**
   Create `.github/workflows/hugo.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches: ["main"]
     workflow_dispatch:

   permissions:
     contents: read
     pages: write
     id-token: write

   concurrency:
     group: "pages"
     cancel-in-progress: false

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           with:
             submodules: true
         - name: Setup Hugo
           uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
           with:
             hugo-version: 'latest'
             extended: true
         - name: Build
           run: hugo --minify
         - name: Upload artifact
           uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
           with:
             path: ./public

     deploy:
       environment:
         name: github-pages
         url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       needs: build
       steps:
         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
           id: deployment
           uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # Add all files
   git add .

   # Commit
   git commit -m "Initial blog setup"

   # Push to main branch
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages"
   - Under "Build and deployment":
     - Source: Choose "GitHub Actions"

## Writing New Posts

To create new posts:
1. Run `hugo new posts/post-name.md`
2. Edit the markdown file in `content/posts/`
3. Set `draft: false` when ready to publish
4. Commit and push changes
5. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your updates

## Customization Tips

1. **Modify Theme Colors**
   Create `assets/css/extended.css` to override theme styles:
   ```css
   :root {
     --primary: #1a1a1a;
     --secondary: #4a4a4a;
     --link-color: #0066cc;
   }
   ```

2. **Add Custom Favicon**
   Place your favicon.ico in the `static` folder

3. **Enable Syntax Highlighting**
   Add to `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [markup]
     [markup.highlight]
       style = "github"
       lineNos = true
   ```

I've created a comprehensive guide for setting up your Hugo blog. The guide includes detailed steps for:
1. Installing prerequisites (Git and Hugo)
2. Setting up your blog locally
3. Installing and configuring a minimalist theme
4. Creating initial content
5. Deploying to GitHub Pages
6. Writing new posts
7. Basic customization options

Would you like me to clarify any particular step or provide more details about a specific part of the setup process?

**Me**

In Hugo there is the following snippet:

```
{{ define "main" }}
  <article class="main">
    {{- with .Title }}
      <header>
        <h1 class="!mb-1">{{ . }}</h1>
      </header>
    {{ end -}}
    {{- with .Content }}
      {{ . }}
    {{ end -}}
```

Where is .Content defined?

**Claude**

In Hugo, `.Content` is a built-in variable that refers to the rendered Markdown content of the current page being processed. It's not something you explicitly define - Hugo automatically populates it based on the content files in your project. Here's how it works:

1. When you create a content file like `content/posts/my-first-post.md`:
```markdown
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2024-10-28
---

This is my blog post content.
Some more paragraphs here...
```

2. Hugo processes this file and:
   - The frontmatter (between `---`) gets parsed into page variables (so `.Title` becomes "My First Post")
   - Everything after the frontmatter is considered the page content and gets converted from Markdown to HTML
   - This converted HTML becomes available as `.Content`

So if your markdown file contains:
```markdown
This is **bold** text and here's a [link](https://example.com).
```

Then `.Content` will contain the HTML:
```html
<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text and here's a <a href="https://example.com">link</a>.</p>
```

Some key points about `.Content`:
- It's automatically available for any content page
- It contains the fully rendered HTML
- It's available in templates when rendering that page
- It excludes the frontmatter
- It's part of Hugo's Page variables (along with others like `.Title`, `.Date`, `.Summary`, etc.)
- For non-content pages (like list pages or the homepage), `.Content` will be empty unless you have an `_index.md` file in the corresponding directory

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Hugo's template variables or content handling?

**Me**

How or where do I define the content for the homepage?

**Claude**

For the homepage in Hugo, you can define the content in one of two ways:

1. Create an `_index.md` file in the root of your `content` directory:

```plaintext
content/
  _index.md    <- This will be your homepage content
  posts/
  about.md
```

The `_index.md` would look something like this:
```markdown
---
title: "Welcome to My Blog"
---

This is my homepage content. I can write anything here using Markdown.

## Recent Projects
- Project A
- Project B

You can find my blog posts in the Posts section.
```

2. Or you can create a custom homepage template in your theme's layout directory:

```plaintext
layouts/
  index.html    <- This overrides the theme's homepage template
```

Here's a sample `index.html` template that shows recent posts:

```html
{{ define "main" }}
  <div class="homepage">
    <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name]. I write about...</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Recent Posts</h2>
    {{ range first 5 (where .Site.RegularPages "Section" "posts") }}
      <article>
        <h3><a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></h3>
        <time>{{ .Date.Format "January 2, 2006" }}</time>
        {{ .Summary }}
      </article>
    {{ end }}
  </div>
{{ end }}
```

The best practice is usually to combine both approaches:
1. Use `content/_index.md` for your main content that you want to edit frequently
2. Use `layouts/index.html` for the structure and dynamic elements like recent posts

Then your `index.html` template could look like:

```html
{{ define "main" }}
  <div class="homepage">
    <!-- Your _index.md content -->
    {{ .Content }}

    <!-- Dynamic recent posts section -->
    <h2>Recent Posts</h2>
    {{ range first 5 (where .Site.RegularPages "Section" "posts") }}
      <article>
        <h3><a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></h3>
        <time>{{ .Date.Format "January 2, 2006" }}</time>
        {{ .Summary }}
      </article>
    {{ end }}
  </div>
{{ end }}
```

This gives you the flexibility to:
- Edit the main content through Markdown (`_index.md`)
- Control the layout and dynamic elements through the template (`index.html`)
- Override the theme's default homepage if needed

Would you like me to explain more about how to customize the homepage layout or how to work with Hugo's template logic?

**Me**


I'm using this blog to collect notes, code snippets, learnings, etc. It's more of a log for myself. Please create a nice short welcome header

**Claude**

I'll create a welcoming but practical header that reflects the personal knowledge-base nature of your blog.

```markdown
---
title: "Digital Garden"
---

Welcome to my digital garden - a collection of notes, code snippets, and learnings I've gathered along the way. This space grows organically as I explore new technologies, solve problems, and document insights. It's more of a work-in-progress than a polished blog; you might find some paths well-trodden and others just beginning to sprout.

[Browse the latest entries →](/posts)
```

Or a more concise alternative:

```markdown
---
title: "Code & Notes"
---

A personal logbook of technical discoveries, useful code snippets, and hard-won learnings. This is where I document things I don't want to forget and solutions I might need again.

[View entries →](/posts)
```

Choose whichever style resonates more with you - you can place either version in your `content/_index.md` file. Would you like me to adjust the tone or length?
