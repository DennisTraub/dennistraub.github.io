I’ve started testing [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/) today. It feels a bit odd after having spent decades working with fully featured IDEs, like IntelliJ IDEA, etc. I'm not sure if I like it yet. But I guess I’ll give it a try for a few days and we’ll see if it can be a lightweight alternative, at least for simple editing, like writing this blog.
