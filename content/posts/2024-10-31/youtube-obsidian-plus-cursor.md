I've been using Obsidian for quite some time, and - frankly - it's become a bit overwhelming. With hundreds of documents, snippets, reminders, and often redundant notes, finding what I need has become increasingly challenging.

To tackle this, I've been thinking about AI integration as a solution and even started developing an Obsidian plugin using Embeddings and Text generation models on [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/generative-ai/bedrock/?trk=bddf5c60-e524-4fac-be77-9847d064e1a7&sc_channel=el). While I got it working technically, I never really found the time to develop it into something truly useful, and it eventually fell by the wayside.

Now, I just came across this YouTube video, [Obsidian + Cursor = Magical AI Knowledge Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxss50uZgE0), where [Ben Hofferber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hofferber-395b1355/) demonstrates an elegant approach using [Cursor's](https://www.cursor.com/) built-in AI capabilities. Instead of working with a code base (Cursor's typical use case), he simply opens his Obsidian vault and engages in a conversation about his notes:

    frameborder="0" 
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
    allowfullscreen>

I think this is a great approach and will definitely give it a try.

**Important Note:** Cursor stores the generated embeddings on their servers, so it's crucial to review your local regulations and your organization's policies before using it with notes containing other people's PII or confidential information.
