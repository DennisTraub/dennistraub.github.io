I'm notoriously bad at CSS! üòÖ

I rarely work with it, so advanced selectors always leave me scratching my head. But thanks to AI, I don't need to memorize them anymore!

Today's example: I needed to style specific elements, but only if they weren't the first one. Instead of googling CSS selectors for the hundredth time, I let Amazon Q's new Inline Chat handle it for me. Here's my workflow:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Select the CSS snippet\
2Ô∏è‚É£ Press Ctrl+i (Cmd+I on Mac) for Q's Inline Chat\
3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain what I need in plain English\
4Ô∏è‚É£ Review Q's generated diff\
5Ô∏è‚É£ Quick sanity check and accept!  

Using AI without interrupting my coding flow really is a game changer!
