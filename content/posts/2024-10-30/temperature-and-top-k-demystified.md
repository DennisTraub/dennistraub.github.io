Most AI models provide temperature and top-k to control response randomness, here's what they do:

🌡️ Temperature (creativity level) - Like a chef in the kitchen: Low means sticking to recipes, high means getting creative with flavors.

▼ Top-k (word choice limits) - Like restricting your chef's pantry. Rarely useful in practice.

Pro tip from AI engineers: Use temperature alone. Let your chef focus on creativity without restrictive ingredient lists!
