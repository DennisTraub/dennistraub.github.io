I’m testing [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/) today. It feels a bit odd because I’m used to fully featured IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, etc. Not sure if I like it yet, but I’ll give it a try for a few days and we’ll see if it can be a lightweight alternative, at least for simple editing, like writing this blog.
